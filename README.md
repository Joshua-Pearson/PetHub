PetHub
======

My first Project!

The #1 Social Pet Sharing Site

Sign in through Facebook and add a new pet in your profile page.<br><br>
Then post on the message board about when your pet is available to be shared with others.<br><br>

Other users can then comment on your message through your pet on their availability to watch or walk it.<br>

Messages are exchanged between pet owners and potential pet watchers.<br>


The technologies used that were most useful:

omniauth-facebook
cancan
carrierwave
